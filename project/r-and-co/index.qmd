Data Analysis is big part of my daily job and I am promoting the use
of [R][r] for reproducibility, exploratory data analysis and for visualization
too (using for example [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/)'s [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/) [@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016]!)


Some of the R packages I have developed/am developing are:

* [`trrrj`][trrrj]: dealing with flight trajectories in R
* [`nvctr`][nvctr]: n-vector approach to geographical position calculations using an ellipsoidal model of Earth
* [`pruatlas`][pruatlas]: some maps facilities for aviation
