I am a curious person fascinated by the collective open knowledge available at our fingertips
(well, at least if you are lucky enough so you can afford decent living conditions).

I am a *curious geek*. I love map projections and calendrical algorithms a lot.

I (sort of) like to tinker with electronics but software is much more malleable and faster to work
with, so, due to lack of time, I mainly play with software...


## Interests

* Aviation
* [Statistical learning](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2020) (mainly the learning ;-)
* [Map projections](https://observablehq.com/collection/@fil/projections)
* [Calendrical algorithms](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/calendar-book/fourth-edition/)
