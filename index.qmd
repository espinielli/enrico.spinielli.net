I am a curious person fascinated by the collective open knowledge available at our fingertips
(well, at least if you are lucky enough so you can afford decent living conditions).

I am a *curious geek*. I love map projections and calendrical algorithms a lot.

I (sort of) like to tinker with electronics but software is much more malleable and faster to work
with, so, due to lack of time, I mainly play with software...
