## Abstract

Air transportation is undergoing a fundamental
transformation. On the political, strategic, and operational level
work is directed to meet the future growth of air traffic. To meet
this goal, operational concepts and technological enablers are deployed with the promises of distinct performance improvements.
These improvements are typically widely marketed, however, the
underlying evidence is not made available. From that respect
Air Navigation System Performance faces varying levels of
transparency as seen in other industries. This paper implements
the reproducibility paradigm by providing data, code, and results
openly to enable another researcher or analyst to reproduce - and
potentially - improve or build on our work. This work is part of a
wider thread to establish Open Data and Open Source based data
analytical capabilities for Air Navigation System Performance in
Europe. The implementation of the paradigm is demonstrated
on the basis of the performance reference trajectory by replicating a classical performance measure, and then moving into
investigating the application of trajectory based information for
enhancing the current state of performance monitoring for the
arrival phase. This paper applies the concept and approach
as a use case analysis for 2 European airports with different
strategies for sequencing arrival traffic (i.e. stack holding and
point merge). The research reported demonstrates the feasibility
of the reproducibility approach. This work introduces a novel
workflow by making available a companion web repository that
provides data, code, and instructions to fully reproduce the paper.
