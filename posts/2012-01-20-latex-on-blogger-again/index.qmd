Revisited in 2022  to make it work wit Quarto...where things are so easy!

<a href="https://ongiantsshoulders.blogspot.com/2009/11/text-on-latex-snippet-in-blogger-from.html">My previous post</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;LaTeX&nbsp;&nbsp;on Blogger&nbsp;reported that the solution described there did not work anymore...<br />Now I found <a href="https://irrep.blogspot.com/2011/07/mathjax-in-blogger-ii.html">a new solution</a> based on <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">mathjax</a>.<br /><br />So let's try it straight away with inline math, like the great equation $e^{-2\pi}$, and with displayed math like the following:

$$
\left [ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V \right ] \Psi<br />= i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi
$$
