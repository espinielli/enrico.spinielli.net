The COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium was officially enforced on noon 18th Mar 2020 but
at home we were already quarantined (kids since Carnival holidays, 24th Feb; me from EOB 13th Mar).
So on my first official telework day, 16th Mar, I finally decided to buy an ebook reader,
and selected Kobo Clara HD.

I like it but still I was curious and looked around for how to hack it.
I found that it is possible to change the original SD card (8 GB) with a bigger one
and decided to give it a go.
This [blog post](https://yingtongli.me/blog/2018/07/29/kobo-sd.html) from 
[Lee Yingtong Li](https://yingtongli.me/) got me started.

I opened it, took the SD card out and copied on a bigger one of 128 GB.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("kobo.png")
```

It all went well apart from the last 2 lines of text:

> Then use a tool like gparted to resize the data partition (the large third partition) on the new microSD card to fill the remaining space.

I tried all kind of things to have [`gparted`](https://gparted.org/) running from
a Mac (docker image, Virtual Box) but
what finally worked for me was to have it on a bootable CD ROM (yes I still have an old machine
with CD reader/writer): I burned the ISO image, booted from it and resized the SD card to all 
available space.
