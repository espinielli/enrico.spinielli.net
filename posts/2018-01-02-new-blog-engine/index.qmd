I finally decided to give it a try and then switched to `blogdown`
([here the free book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).)

I sort of followed the migration suggestions in the book, but when I tried to
switch to [Netlify](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html)
I got everyting messed up with my OVH setup so I am still
with Github Pages...one step at a time...

I hope this setup will lower the barrier and allow me to blog and share more.

I am already looking forward to using the amazing features provided by
Hugo, e.g. [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).
So if I want to cite one of my tweets I simply use `blogdown::shortcode(...)`
