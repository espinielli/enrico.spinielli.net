I found and liked a very good summary of the 'Maxwell Equations of software'
motto from Alan Kay in
[this post](https://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/)
from Michael Nielsen.

It is nice also because it has running code inspired by all the gurus and books
I like: [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay),
