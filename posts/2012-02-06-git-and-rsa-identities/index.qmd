Here is the solution I found to be able to use `git` with a different RSA identity than the `rsa_id`
default one.

My repo on github is `logback-android` and my user account is `espinielli`.

I did generate an SSH key as per github help and named it `github_rsa`:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com" -f github_rsa
```

I then added the following section in `~/.ssh/config`

```
# github for espinielli
Host github
HostName github.com
User espinielli
IdentityFile /Users/espin/.ssh/github_rsa
```

From within the repo directory (I cloned it before via http):

```
$ git remote add gh ssh://git@github.com/espinielli/logback-android.git
```

And finally I am able to use it like this:

```
$ git push gh master
```
