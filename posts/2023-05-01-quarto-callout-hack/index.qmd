The Quarto Guide goes into details about how to define [callout blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html) and eventually customize them.

Of course, I was asked to change the color of the callout box, which is not out-of-the-box available.
A look at the generated LaTeX file shows that `quarto-callout-note-color` is set as

```{latex}
\definecolor{quarto-callout-note-color-frame}{HTML}{4582ec}
```

I then tried to add a different definition using `include-in-header:`...but the default definitions of the callout boxes colors came after mine!

So I dug in the [PDF template](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/b4bed358294188378d21bec81a307fa3246b3a69/src/resources/formats/pdf/pandoc/template.tex) and saw that latest place where to set things before the LaTeX body
is to provide a custom `title.tex` partial

```{latex}
...
$title.tex()$
\begin{document}
$before-body.tex()$
...
```

The solution: I copied the default [`title.tex`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/b3b969f570585cf55bc9fe35ece4a9b2878a1f22/src/resources/formats/pdf/pandoc/title.tex) and added my color definition.
Finally I set the YAML of my Quarto document as follows:

```{yml}
...
  pdf:
  	...
    template-partials:
      - title.tex
...
```


TADA!
