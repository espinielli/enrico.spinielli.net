Brussels is not the paradise for electronics hobbists.\n\nEBay to [the rescue](https://www.ebay.com/bhp/samsung-galaxy-s2-charging-port): one piece can cost as little as 0.30 EUR if bought in lots of thousands (but I need just one!), then I found a single piece at 3.29 CAD (shipping included), still a cheap enough option.\nThe order date is Nov 27, 2014, shipped the day after.\n\n## A long wait ##\nHere we are! On 29th Dec 2015 I come home from holidays and it arrived!\nAnd the evening after while the kids play with Legos, Daddy repairs (and has fun with) the phone\n\n![repairing](repair-samsung-s2-play-with-lego.png)\n\n<br/>\nAll is good: USB is charging again, no shortcuts, no erratic shutdowns...Victory!\n\n![fixed](usb-fixed.jpeg)\n\n## Mayday, Mayday! ##\nAll seemed good, but the radio signal is very, very weak!\n\nSo weak that at times I have no gsm/data connection!\n\nHhuumm, maybe that is due to the fact that the replacement piece I bought was revision 2.3 ...\n\n![the new piece](new-usb-charger-connector-samsung-galaxy-s2-i9100.png)\n\n... while the original one was 2.2 ...\n\n![the new piece](old-usb-charger-connector-samsung-galaxy-s2-i9100.png)\n\n<br/>\nBack to basics, google search to the rescue: I found an \n[article by Rich Oâ€™Neil](https://www.oneilusm.com/?p=518) citing a \n[post on xda-developers ](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=37914192&postcount=32) \nfrom a certain Serathian who simply cut the PCB in two.\n\nHere is what he did:\n\n![cut the pcb in two](cut-the-pcb.png)\n\n\nThe left part is responsible for the radio while the right part is the USB.\n\n<br/>\nOk, few days later I take a scissor and use the radio part from the old piece (rev 2.2) and the USB part from the new (rev 2.3): *VICTORY* !\n\nPhone is now fixed! (It is 6th Jan 2015.)\n<br/>\nThanks all for sharing (and some [huge company](https://google.com) to let me find it)!\n",
