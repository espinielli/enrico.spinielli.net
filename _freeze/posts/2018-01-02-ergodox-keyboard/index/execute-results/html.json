I did some ten/twenty SMD diodes.\n\nThen I continued with my little iron but soon after it failed miserably of old age.\nSo I could not solder any more. My Eurocontrol collegue \"Tasso\" to the rescue:\nhe provided with a new iron and then work could continue.\n\nBut kids' summer holidays were now over so no more time for me to tinker!\nIt'll all have to wait 2015.\n\nNow in July 2015 all started again, the pain continued thanks to those little\ntiny SMD diodes and them being 76! Pain, pain, pain.\n\nI did a small test completing first a column on the left side and a few keys on the\nright half, loaded the firmaware: it all worked. So now _just_ a matter of finishing up.\nBut again time was up...completion had to wait for next summer holidays.\n\n\nSummer 2016 was great: I finished everything up and was ready to try it.\n\nBuuuum! Some keys were not working.\n\nSoon I noticed that it was a full column and then I inspected my soldering and found\nthat on one of the keys it was really a mess.\nA quick fix made it all work correctly!!!!\n\n**SUCCESS**\n\nI decided to keep a QWERTY layout, but I have not yet really execised for touch typing.\nThat seems to need so much commitment!\n",
