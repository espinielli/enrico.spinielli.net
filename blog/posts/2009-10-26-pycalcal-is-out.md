I finally set to put [PyCalCal](https://code.google.com/p/pycalcal/) out in the open.

I will need to finalize and perfect it but that is a good starting point.

I also added a [demo web app](https://code.google.com/p/pycalcal/) using it.


My idea is for PyCalCal to be used as a Python library and as such use it to provide calendrica calculations as web services.

Stay tuned if you are interested.
