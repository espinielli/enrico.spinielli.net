I'm an Italian :it: living in Brussels, Belgium.

I work in the [Aviation Intelligence Unit](https://ansperformance.eu) of the [European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation](https://www.eurocontrol.int) (a.k.a. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">EUROCONTROL</span>).

**I love open source software** and am grateful to all the ones contributing to it.
I, too, try to participate a little with bug fixes, typo corrections, some code of my own or just appreciation.

Did I say I also love open data? No? Ok, so **I love open data** because I am convinced it is an instrument for citizens, and civil society to support democracy, i.e. transparency and accountability.
