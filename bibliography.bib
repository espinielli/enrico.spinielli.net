  abstract = {Ultrasonic pulse-echo ranging systems based on threshold detection methods are popular devices in the robotic field, as a means for determining the proximity of objects in a cost-effective manner. Despite their widespread use, serious concerns are often raised regarding the accuracy of the sensed data, particularly when the return signals are received at low signal-to-noise ratios. In principle, correlation-based detection methods provide better performance for their outstanding capability of detecting and recovering weak signals buried in noise, so as to permit ranging at longer distances, or, the distance being the same, at higher frequencies, with resulting improvements in spatial resolution in spite of the increased attenuation. In this paper the authors describe a simple pulse-echo ranging system whose receiver signal processing is completely digital: the use of appropriate sampling techniques and signal processing algorithms allows one to benefit from the advantages of correlation-based detection methods for accurate ranging of multiple objects, without compromising the most prominent features of pulse-echo sonar systems, namely their relatively low cost and simplicity of operation. The experimental results presented concern the use of relatively high-frequency ultrasonic transducers},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use, sharing, and distribution of data on a global basis. Higher levels of transparency were achieved with continual updates of pandemic related information. The air transportation sector \textendash{} while by definition an information rich industry \textendash{} is a notable exception. While different organizations offered aggregated data on air traffic developments on national or airport level, complementary data on air traffic movements for further analysis are not available publicly. This creates a deadlock between addressing the societal needs of monitoring how aviation recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and addresses the aspirational environmental goals. This paper investigates the feasibility of utilizing open data for the operational performance monitoring at airports. The exploratory work focusses on a subset of the indicators proposed under ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan used to assess the operational performance in the arrival phase. A novel approach to characterize and assess the arrival flow management and level of traffic synchronization is presented. This will allow to evaluate on-going air traffic recovery and identify operational bottlenecks. The study is performed as a use-case analysis for three major European airports by comparing the observed performance in the months of March and May for the successive years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The results demonstrate the general feasibility and utility of open data for operational performance monitoring. The classical performance measure for the arrival flow are determined based on the open trajectory data. A geospatial-temporal evaluation support the tracking of traffic synchronisation effort. A higher level of transparency therefore available to the interested public, policy decision-makers and strategic planners with direct feedback on the recovery and actual operational performance. The suitability of the traffic synchronization measure and its parameterization requires further validation across a wider set of airports and will be iteratively refined.}

  abstract = {Air transportation is undergoing a fundamental transformation. On the political, strategic, and operational level work is directed to meet the future growth of air traffic. To meet this goal, operational concepts and technological enablers are deployed with the promises of distinct performance improvements. These improvements are typically widely marketed, however, the underlying evidence is not made available. From that respect Air Navigation System Performance faces varying levels of transparency as seen in other industries. This paper implements the reproducibility paradigm by providing data, code, and results openly to enable another researcher or analyst to reproduce - and potentially - improve or build on our work. This work is part of a wider thread to establish Open Data and Open Source based data analytical capabilities for Air Navigation System Performance in Europe. The implementation of the paradigm is demonstrated on the basis of the performance reference trajectory by replicating a classical performance measure, and then moving into investigating the application of trajectory based information for enhancing the current state of performance monitoring for the arrival phase. This paper applies the concept and approach as a use case analysis for 2 European airports with different strategies for sequencing arrival traffic (i.e. stack holding and point merge). The research reported demonstrates the feasibility of the reproducibility approach. This work introduces a novel workflow by making available a companion web repository that provides data, code, and instructions to fully reproduce the paper.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the feasibility of using open data and an open source toolbox for ensuring reproducibility in operational performance analysis of air navigation services. To date the access to operational data in support of research claims or observed performance benefits is limited. Though the majority of related data sets are established and curated by government authorities, open data access is still in its infancy. ICAO promotes a performance based approach. In that light there is stronger interest in performing regional and international benchmarking comparisons. To advance the state of the art it is important to establish common methods and tools. This paper reports on the conceptualization of the benchmarking process as a data analytical workflow and the supporting developments of an open-source data-analytical toolbox. This feasibility study demonstrates the use of the process and open data to provide a framework under which official results can be validated. The benefits of this approach have been demonstrated throughout the on-going regional benchmarking projects. The toolbox developed offers scope to expand the functionality and make operational ANS performance analyses accessible to a wider audience interested in applying harmonized global standards.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The strong reduction of air traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique test case for the relationship between air traffic density, contrails, and their radiative forcing of climate change. Here, air traffic and contrail cirrus changes are quantified for a European domain for March to August 2020 and compared to the same period in 2019. Traffic data show a 72 \% reduction in flight distance compared with 2019. This paper investigates the induced contrail changes in a model study. The contrail model results depend on various methodological details as discussed in parameter studies. In the reference case, the reduced traffic caused a reduction in contrail length. The reduction is slightly stronger than expected from the traffic change because the weather conditions in 2020 were less favorable for contrail formation than in 2019. Contrail coverage over Europe with an optical depth larger than 0.1 decreased from 4.6 \% in 2019 to 1.4 \% in 2020; the total cirrus cover amount changed by 28 \% to 25 \%. The reduced contrail coverage caused 70 \% less longwave and 73 \% less shortwave radiative forcing but, because of various nonlinearities, only 54 \% less net forcing in this case. The methods include recently developed models for performance parameters and soot emissions. The overall propulsion efficiency of the aircraft is about 20 \% smaller than estimated in earlier studies, resulting in 3 \% fewer contrails. Considerable sensitivity to soot emissions is found, highlighting fuel and engine importance. The contrail model includes a new approximate method to account for water vapor exchange between contrails and background air and for radiative forcing changes due to contrail\textendash contrail overlap. The water vapor exchange reduces available ice supersaturation in the atmosphere, which is critical for contrail formation. Contrail\textendash contrail overlap changes the computed radiative forcing considerably. Comparisons to satellite observations are described and discussed in a parallel publication.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Air Navigation Service1 (ANS) performance review needs to be based on an open set of flown flight trajectories and computed according to published, accepted standards and methodology. This paper describes the set-up of such a trajectory repository for the European region, the associated cloud based trajectory processing infrastructure and trajectory production algorithms. It also demonstrates the application for an initial use case within the terminal area. With a view to enhance transparency of performance results and to increase the level of reproducibility, we have developed a system to combine different data sources in order to produce a freely available set of flown flight trajectories for the assessment of European ANS performance. The capability is demonstrated on the basis of a use case analysis of holding patterns at a major European airport. Stakeholders are capable of reproducing the results by inspecting the underlying data processing and sample data. The presented cloud based infrastructure and processing setup form the nucleus of a reproducible and open data based approach to ANS performance in Europe. Both will be iteratively further developed to achieve the overarching goal of reproducible ANS Performance Review in Europe.},
